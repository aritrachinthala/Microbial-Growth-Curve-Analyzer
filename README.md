# Microbial-Growth-Curve-Analyzer
Microbial Growth Curve Analyzer is a Python tool that visualizes microbial growth using time vs OD600 data and calculates key growth parameters. It plots the growth curve, allows manual log-phase selection, and computes specific growth rate (μ) and doubling time using NumPy and Matplotlib.
